Alvienne Ysabelle Abundo

My motivation for joining Zuitt Open House is
that I want to learn and become a Web
Developer, or at least learn the tools
without being oblivious and with great help
doing so

I have no work experience other than 
a few personal projects and various 
courses and certificates
